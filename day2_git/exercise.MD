# Version Control using Git Exercise

First time set up to configure your identity. Look at the slide "First time Git setup".


## Build a local repository from scratch

TODO: 
- Initialize an empty git repository in your /home directory, e.g., `/home/hpctrn01/myrepo`.
- Create a new text file named "myfirstfile.txt" in the repository
- Add the following three lines step by step to the myfirstfile.txt, each time you add a line, use git to add your changes and commit to the repository:
> `I learned Git Version Control today.`

> `Git is flexible.`

> `Git is easy to use.`

- *If you are new to using text editors on Linux you probably want to use nano instead of vi/emacs as your default text editor.*
